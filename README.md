# Stock-Market-Forecasting
This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts stock market trends, specifically focusing on predicting the target value for the next day. The goal is to help decide whether a particular companyâ€™s stock is suitable for buying or selling based on its predicted behavior. The model uses historical stock data to make these predictions and applies advanced techniques to make the process more accurate and efficient.

# Used Framework

## 3. Lag Features
   
  Provides information on immediate historical performance.

  Lag_Close_1:
  The closing price of the stock on the previous trading day.
  
  Lag_Close_5:
  The closing price of the stock five trading days ago.
  
  Lag_Volume_1:
  The trading volume on the previous trading day.

## 4. Rolling Statistics
   
  Provide a dynamic view of trends and patterns over a defined period.

   Volatility_30Day:
     Rolling 30-day standard deviation of log returns of the adjusted close price.
   
   MovingAvg_20Day:
     Rolling 20-day mean of the adjusted close price.

## 5. Technical Indicator
   
  ATR (Average True Range):
  Measures the average range (high-low differences) over the last 5 days, incorporating gaps from the previous close.
