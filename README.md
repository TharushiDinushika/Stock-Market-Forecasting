## Stock-Market-Forecasting
This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts stock market trends, specifically focusing on predicting the target value for the next day. The goal is to help decide whether a particular companyâ€™s stock is suitable for buying or selling based on its predicted behavior. The model uses historical stock data to make these predictions and applies advanced techniques to make the process more accurate and efficient.
